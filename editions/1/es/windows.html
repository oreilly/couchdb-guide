<h2 id="windows">Installing on Windows</h2>

<p>CouchDB does not officially support Windows. CouchDB intends to provide an official Windows installer at some point in the future, so this may change. At the time this book is going to print, there is, however, an <a href="http://people.apache.org/~mhammond/dist/">unofficial binary installer</a>.

<p>This is unofficial software, so please remember to exercise additional caution when downloading or installing it, as it may damage your system. Imagine a fearsomely comprehensive disclaimer of author liability. Now fear, comprehensively.

<p>We recommend that you ask on the CouchDB mailing lists for further help.

<p>CouchDB will have official Windows support as part of the 1.0 release.
