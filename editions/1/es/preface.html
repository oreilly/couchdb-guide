<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Thanks for purchasing this book! If it was a gift, then congratulations. If, on the other hand, you downloaded it without paying, well, actually, we’re pretty happy about that too! This book is available under a free license, and that’s important because we want it to serve the community as documentation—and documentation should be free.

<p>So, why pay for a free book? Well, you might like the warm fuzzy feeling you get from holding a book in your hands, as you cosy up on the couch with a cup of coffee. On the couch...get it? Bad jokes aside, whatever your reasons, buying the book helps support us, so we have more time to work on improvements for both the book and CouchDB. So thank you!

<p>We set out to compile the best and most comprehensive collection of CouchDB information there is, and yet we know we failed. CouchDB is a fast-moving target and grew significantly during the time we were writing the book. We were able to adapt quickly and keep things up-to-date, but we also had to draw the line somewhere if we ever hoped to publish it.

<p>At the time of this writing, CouchDB 0.10.1 is the latest release, but you might already be seeing 0.10.2 or even 0.11.0 released or being prepared—maybe even 1.0. Although we have some ideas about how future releases will look, we don’t know for certain and didn’t want to make any wild guesses. CouchDB is a community project, so ultimately it’s up to you, our readers, to help shape the project.

<p>On the plus side, many people successfully run CouchDB 0.10 in production, and you will have more than enough on your hands to run a solid project. Future releases of CouchDB will make things easier in places, but the core features should remain the same. Besides, learning the core features helps you understand and appreciate the shortcuts and allows you to roll your own hand-tailored solutions.

<p>Writing an open book was great fun. We’re happy O’Reilly supported our decision in every way possible. The best part—besides giving the CouchDB community early access to the material—was the commenting functionality we implemented on the <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax">book’s website</a>. It allows anybody to comment on any paragraph in the book with a simple click. We used some simple JavaScript and Google Groups to allow painless commenting. The result was astounding. As of today, 866 people have sent more than 1,100 messages to our little group. Submissions have ranged from pointing out small typos to deep technical discussions. Feedback on our original first chapter led us to a complete rewrite in order to make sure the points we wanted to get across did, indeed, get across. This system allowed us to clearly formulate what we wanted to say in a way that worked for you, our readers.

<p>Overall, the book has become so much better because of the help of hundreds of volunteers who took the time to send in their suggestions. We understand the immense value this model has, and we want to keep it up. New features in CouchDB should make it into the book without us necessarily having to do a reprint every thee months. The publishing industry is not ready for that yet, but we want to continue to release new and revised content and listen closely to the feedback. The specifics of how we’ll do this are still in flux, but we’ll be posting the information to the book’s website the first moment we know it. That’s a promise! So make sure to visit the book’s website at <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax">http://books.couchdb.org/relax</a> to keep up-to-date.

<p>Before we let you dive into the book, we want to make sure you’re well prepared. CouchDB is written in Erlang, but you don’t need to know anything about Erlang to use CouchDB. CouchDB also heavily relies on web technologies like HTTP and JavaScript, and some experience with those does help when following the examples throughout the book. If you have built a website before—simple or complex—you should be ready to go.

<p>If you are an experienced developer or systems architect, the introduction to CouchDB should be comforting, as you already know everything involved—all you need to learn are the ways CouchDB puts them together. Toward the end of the book, we ramp up the experience level to help you get as comfortable building large-scale CouchDB systems as you are with personal projects.

<p>If you are a beginning web developer, don’t worry—by the time you get to the later parts of the book, you should be able to follow along with the harder stuff.

<p>Now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride through the wonderful world of CouchDB.

<h3 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3>

<h4 id="jchris">J. Chris</h4>

<p>I would like to acknowledge all the committers of CouchDB, the people sending patches, and the rest of the community. I couldn’t have done it without my wife, Amy, who helps me think about the big picture; without the patience and support of my coauthors and O’Reilly; nor without the help of everyone who helped us hammer out book content details on the mailing lists. And a shout-out to the copyeditor, who was awesome!

<h4 id="jan">Jan</h4>

<p>I would like to thank the CouchDB community. Special thanks go out to a number of nice people all over the place who invited me to attend or talk at a conference, who let me sleep on their couches (pun most definitely intended), and who made sure I had a good time when I was abroad presenting CouchDB. There are too many to name, but all of you in Dublin, Portland, Lisbon, London, Zurich, San Francisco, Mountain View, Dortmund, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Salt Lake City, Blacksburg, San Diego, and Amsterdam: you know who you are—thanks!

<p>To my family, friends, and coworkers: thanks you for your support and your patience with me over the last year. You won’t hear, “I’ve got to leave early, I have a book to write” from me anytime soon, promise!

<p>Anna, you believe in me; I couldn’t have done this without you.

<h4 id="noah">Noah</h4>

<p>I would like to thank O’Reilly for their enthusiasm in CouchDB and for realizing the importance of free documentation. And of course, I’d like to thank Jan and J. Chris for being so great to work with. But a special thanks goes out to the whole CouchDB community, for making everything so fun and rewarding. Without you guys, none of this would be possible. And if you’re reading this, that means you!
